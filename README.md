This repository contains the solution for both CSS and JS exercises.

The solution for the CSS exercise uses `React` to render the navbar.

The solution for the JS exercise can be found inside the `utils.js` file.

This file is included in the `index.html` , so opening this page should trigger the function that will transform the API response and output the result into the browser console.
